    /**
     * Example implementation of Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC) for Interledger.
     * HTLC allows parties (A and B in this example) to exchange assets securely.
     * This HTLC implementation allows parties to exchange ethers, and it can be exteneded
     * to support the exchange of any kind of ledger-based assets. The implementation works
     * as follows (both A and B act as a sender in their smart contracts, and as a receiver
     * in other party's smart contract):
     *
     * 1. Sender deposits funds using depositFunds() by specifying a receiver,
     *    lock value H(s) and time when funds be available for refund (timeout).
     *
     * 2. Anyone can unlock the fund transfer to the receiver by calling withdrawFunds()
     *    with a proper lock value and key.
     *
     * 3. If the funds have not been withdrawn, the sender can receive its funds back after
     *    the timeout by providing a lock value to the recoverFunds().
     *
     *
     * SOFIE Interledger component can be used to automate the last step of the exchange in a
     * case where the assets and associated smart contracts are located on different ledgers:
     * 1. The Interledger component is listening for events emitted by B's smart contract.
     *
     * 2. On B's smart contract, withdrawFunds() function (if withdrawal is successful)
     *    emits InterledgerEventSending event containing lock value and secret key
     *    packed as data field of the event.
     *
     * 3. After receiving an event from B's ledger, Interledger calls interledgerReceive()
     *    function from A's ledger, with the received data from B's ledger as the payload.
     *
     * 4. interledgerReceive() on A's ledger unpacks the values (lock value and secret key)
     *    and calls withdrawFunds() function with these values, which will result
     *    in transfering assets to B.
